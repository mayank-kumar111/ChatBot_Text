# step-1
# Create a folder and open vs code in it .

# step-2
# open terminal and write
# conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
# conda activate venv/

# step-3
# create a 'requirements.txt' file in which we have to put our packages
# streamlit   ====> for ui
# python-dotenv ===>connect your secrets to your app.py
# google-generativeai ==> genai library

# step-4
# open the terminal and write
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# it will install all the packages that we have to needed in our application
# pip stands for python Installer Packages

# In app.py
# function ==> as argument his/her query ===> google model hit ===> response return

# step-4
# from dotenv import load_dotenv
# load_dotenv()

# import streamlit as st
# import os
# import google.generativeai as genai

# genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))

# model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")

# def my_output(query):
#     response = model.generate_content(query)
#     return response.text

# #### UI Development using streamlit

# st.set_page_config(page_title="SMART_BOT")
# st.header("SMART_BOT")
# input = st.text_input("Input " , key = "input")
# submit = st.button("Ask your query")

# if submit :
#     response = my_output(input)
#     st.subheader("The Response is=")
#     st.write(response)

# Now open the terminal and write
# streamlit run app.py

# How can we deploy our application ???

# go to github ==> create your accout
# Install git bash
# Project ===> open git bash

# git init
# git add app.py
# git add requirements.txt
# git commit -m "added"

# open github ===> create a new repo ===>
